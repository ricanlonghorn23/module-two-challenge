# Module Two Challenge 

## This Challenge contains my portfolio to include links for the following:
- Pre-Work Site
- Module-One Site
- Module-Two Repository
- Resume


I wanted to create a portfoilio so that when someone wants my professional information they have it at tje click of a button. This also shows that I learned different types of CSS styling and creating a site from scratch. This will help get information out without having to be there to introduce myself.

## Installation
To access enviornment follow link: https://github.com/ricanlonghorn23/module-two-challenge.git 

## Usage
This would be used if anyone wanted my professional information. 

## Credits
